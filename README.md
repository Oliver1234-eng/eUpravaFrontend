# This is an application (Java Spring Boot microservices + Angular + Docker) designed for government administration. It consists of 3 microservices representing government authorities - cadastre, registrar, and notary. Each of them has functionalities specific to their systems, but interoperability has also been implemented between information systems to digitize and expedite processes within eGovernment. For example, when a citizen schedules an appointment to sign a land transfer document with a notary, the notary can verify with the registrar whether the citizen is in the required kinship with the current landowner. If everything is in order and the document is signed, the landowner's information in the cadastre database will automatically be updated, and a new history of changes to the land will be recorded. This way, many eGovernment tasks are digitized and automated, reducing the potential for citizens to wait in long lines at government offices when they need to perform certain tasks with government authorities.
